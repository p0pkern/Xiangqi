(Chinese Chess) in Python 3
- Backend is made with Python 3 and will use dictionaries/lists to keep track of piece moves and locations
- GUI will be implemented in Pygame as soon as the backend structure is complete

## Installation
Currently the only way to launch this is to clone repository and run in IDE of choice. As soon as I figure out how to make it launchable I'll implement it.
