# Xiangqi 
(Chinese Chess) in Python 3
- Backend is made with Python 3 and will use dictionaries/lists to keep track of piece moves and locations
- GUI will be implemented in Pygame as soon as the backend structure is complete

## Current Version Notes
Just added the Advisor to the board. Everything seems to work well, need to upload to Github and run tests.

## Installation
Currently the only way to launch this is to clone repository and run in IDE of choice. As soon as I figure out how to make it launchable I'll implement it.

## Contributing
This is a personal project for my portfolio. Suggestions are always welcome.
