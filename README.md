# Xiangqi 
(Chinese Chess) in Python 3
- Backend is made with Python 3 and will use dictionaries/lists to keep track of piece moves and locations
- GUI will be implemented in Pygame as soon as the backend structure is complete

## Installation
Currently the only way to launch this is to clone repository and run in IDE of choice. As soon as I figure out how to make it launchable I'll implement it.

## Contributing
This is a personal project for my portfolio. Suggestions are always welcome.

## Current Version Notes 
- TODO - (Later) Find moments to combine repeated code in to functions.
- TODO - Go back to Elephant and apply format from Horse to Elephant.
- 6/21/20 - Fixed horse movements, utilized index_number rather than location
- 6/20/20 - Horse piece movements added need to compensate for reverse indexing.
